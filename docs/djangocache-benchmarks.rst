DiskCache DjangoCache Benchmarks
================================

:doc:`DiskCache <index>` provides a Django-compatible cache API in
:class:`diskcache.DjangoCache`. A discussion of its options and abilities are
described in the :doc:`tutorial <tutorial>`. Here we try to assess its
performance compared to other Django cache backends.

Keys and Values
---------------

A survey of repositories on Github showed a diversity of cached values. Among
those observed values were:

1. Processed text, most commonly HTML. The average HTML page size in 2014 was
   59KB. Javascript assets totalled an average of 295KB and images range
   dramatically but averaged 1.2MB.
2. QuerySets, the building blocks of the Django ORM.
3. Numbers, settings, and labels. Generally small values that vary in how often
   they change.

The diversity of cached values presents unique challenges. Below, keys and
values, are constrained simply to short byte strings. This is done to filter
out overhead from pickling, etc. from the benchmarks.

Backends
--------

Django ships with four cache backends: Memcached, Database, Filesystem, and
Local-memory. The Memcached backend uses the `PyLibMC`_ client backend.
Included in the results below is also Redis provided by the `django-redis`_
project built atop `redis-py`_.

Not included were four projects which were difficult to setup and so
impractical for testing.

1. | uWSGI cache backend.
   | https://pypi.python.org/pypi/django-uwsgi-cache
2. | Amazon S3 backend.
   | https://pypi.python.org/pypi/django-s3-cache
3. | MongoDB cache backend.
   | https://pypi.python.org/pypi/django-mongodb-cash-backend
4. | Cacheops - incompatible filebased caching.
   | https://pypi.python.org/pypi/django-cacheops

Other caching related projects worth mentioning:

5. | Request-specific in-memory cache.
   | http://pythonhosted.org/johnny-cache/localstore_cache.html
6. | Cacheback moves all cache store operations to background Celery tasks.
   | https://pypi.python.org/pypi/django-cacheback
7. | Newcache claims to improve Django's Memcached backend.
   | https://pypi.python.org/pypi/django-newcache
8. | Supports tagging cache entries.
   | https://pypi.python.org/pypi/cache-tagging

There are also Django packages which automatically cache database queries by
patching the ORM. `Cachalot`_ has a good comparison and discussion in its
introduction.

Filebased
---------

Django's filesystem cache backend has a severe drawback. Every `set` operation
checks whether a cull operation is necessary. This check requires listing all
the files in the directory. To do so a call to ``glob.glob1`` is made. As the
directory size increases, the call slows linearly.

============ ============
Timings for glob.glob1
-------------------------
       Count         Time
============ ============
           1      1.602ms
          10      2.213ms
         100      8.946ms
        1000     65.869ms
       10000    604.972ms
      100000      6.450s
============ ============

Above, the count regards the number of files in the directory and the time is
the duration of the function call. At only a hundred files, it takes more than
five milliseconds to construct the list of files.

Concurrent Access
-----------------

The concurrent access workload starts eight worker processes each with
different and interleaved operations. None of these benchmarks saturated all
the processors. Operations used 1,100 unique keys and, where applicable, caches
were limited to 1,000 keys. This was done to illustrate the impact of the
culling strategy in ``locmem`` and ``filebased`` caches.

Get
...

.. image:: _static/djangocache-get.png

Under heavy load, :class:`DjangoCache <diskcache.DjangoCache>` gets are very
low latency. At the 99th percentile they are on par with the Memcached cache
backend.

Set
...

.. image:: _static/djangocache-set.png

Not displayed above is the filebased cache backend. At all percentiles, the
latency exceeded five milliseconds. Timing data is available below. Though
:doc:`DiskCache <index>` is the slowest, its latency remains competitive.

Delete
......

.. image:: _static/djangocache-delete.png

Like sets, deletes require writes to disk. Though :class:`DjangoCache
<diskcache.DjangoCache>` is the slowest, it remains competitive with latency
less than five milliseconds. Remember that unlike Local-memory, Memached, and
Redis, it persists all cached data.

Timing Data

Not all data is easily displayed in the graphs above. Miss rate, maximum
latency and total latency is recorded below.

Notice the high cache miss rate. This reflects the isolation of local memory
caches from each other. Also the culling strategy of local memory caches is
random.

Memcached performance is low latency and very stable.

Redis performance is roughly half that of Memcached. Beware the impact of
persistence settings on your Redis performance. Depending on your use of
logging and snapshotting, maximum latency may increase significantly.

:class:`DjangoCache <diskcache.DjangoCache>` defaults to using eight shards
with a 10 millisecond timeout. Notice that cache get operations are in
aggregate more than twice as fast as Memcached. And total cache time for all
operations is comparable. The higher set and delete latencies are due to the
retry behavior of :class:`DjangoCache <diskcache.DjangoCache>` objects. If
lower latency is required then the retry behavior can be disabled.

========= ========= ========= ========= ========= ========= ========= =========

Notice the higher cache miss rate. That's a result of the cache's random
culling strategy. Get and set operations also take three to twenty times longer
in aggregate as compared with :class:`DjangoCache <diskcache.DjangoCache>`.
