DiskCache Cache Benchmarks
==========================

Accurately measuring performance is a difficult task. The benchmarks on this
page are synthetic in the sense that they were designed to stress getting,
setting, and deleting items repeatedly. Measurements in production systems are
much harder to reproduce reliably. So take the following data with a `grain of
salt`_. A stated feature of :doc:`DiskCache <index>` is performance so we would
be remiss not to produce this page with comparisons.

The source for all benchmarks can be found under the "tests" directory in the
source code repository. Measurements are reported by percentile: median, 90th
percentile, 99th percentile, and maximum along with total time and miss
rate. The average is not reported as its less useful in response-time
scenarios. Each process in the benchmark executes 100,000 operations with ten
times as many sets as deletes and ten times as many gets as sets.

Each comparison includes `Memcached`_ and `Redis`_ with default client and
server settings. Note that these backends work differently as they communicate
over the localhost network. The also require a server process running and
maintained. All keys and values are short byte strings to reduce the network
impact.

Single Access
-------------

The single access workload starts one worker processes which performs all
operations. No concurrent cache access occurs.

Get
...

Above displays cache access latency at three percentiles. Notice the
performance of :doc:`DiskCache <index>` is faster than highly optimized
memory-backed server solutions.

Set
...

.. image:: _static/core-p1-set.png

Above displays cache store latency at three percentiles. The cost of writing to
disk is higher but still sub-millisecond. All data in :doc:`DiskCache <index>`
is persistent.

Delete
......

.. image:: _static/core-p1-delete.png

Above displays cache delete latency at three percentiles. As above, deletes
require disk writes but latency is still sub-millisecond.

Timing Data

Not all data is easily displayed in the graphs above. Miss rate, maximum
latency and total latency is recorded below.

The generated workload includes a ~1% cache miss rate. All items were stored
with no expiry. The miss rate is due entirely to gets after deletes.

has a negligible impact on performance.

Redis performance is roughly half that of Memcached. :doc:`DiskCache <index>`
performs better than Redis for get operations through the Max percentile.

Concurrent Access
-----------------

The concurrent access workload starts eight worker processes each with
different and interleaved operations. None of these benchmarks saturated all
the processors.

Get
...

.. image:: _static/core-p8-get.png

Under heavy load, :doc:`DiskCache <index>` gets are very low latency. At the
90th percentile, they are less than half the latency of Memcached.

Set
...

.. image:: _static/core-p8-set.png

Stores are much slower under load and benefit greatly from sharding. Not
displayed are latencies in excess of five milliseconds. With one shard
allocated per worker, latency is within a magnitude of memory-backed server
solutions.

Delete
......

.. image:: _static/core-p8-delete.png

Again deletes require writes to disk. Only the :class:`FanoutCache
<diskcache.FanoutCache>` performs well with one shard allocated per worker.

Not all data is easily displayed in the graphs above. Miss rate, maximum
latency and total latency is recorded below.

Notice the unacceptably high maximum store and delete latency. Without
sharding, cache writers block each other. By default :class:`Cache
<diskcache.Cache>` objects raise a timeout error after sixty seconds.

Here :class:`FanoutCache <diskcache.FanoutCache>` uses four shards to
distribute writes. That reduces the maximum latency by a factor of ten. Note
the miss rate is variable due to the interleaved operations of concurrent
workers.

With one shard allocated per worker and a low timeout, the maximum latency is
more reasonable and corresponds to the specified 10 millisecond timeout. Some
set and delete operations were therefore canceled and recorded as cache
misses. The miss rate due to timeout is about 0.01% so our success rate is
four-nines or 99.99%.

Memcached performance is low latency and stable even under heavy load. Notice
that cache gets are three times slower in total as compared with
:class:`FanoutCache <diskcache.FanoutCache>`. The superior performance of get
operations put the overall performance of :doc:`DiskCache <index>` ahead of
Memcached.

Redis performance is roughly half that of Memcached. Beware the impact of
persistence settings on your Redis performance. Depending on your use of
logging and snapshotting, maximum latency may increase significantly.
